       "Okay two questions. For starters I work in food service and I wash my hands dozens of times a day. No one else at my work seems to experience this I’m assuming it’s contact dermatitis. I experience bleeding and cracking. It’s usually not itchy but sometimes it can be. Usually I experience an intense burning feeling. I also live in Alaska and it’s obviously a very dry climate here. This picture is actually what my hands look like on a good day. Does this appear to be contact dermatitis? 2nd question is, I work full time, and am also a full time college student so I don’t have the time to go to a doctor/ the money. What remedies can I use on my hands to help with this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "I have had this divot or something on my chin for a while, I only noticed it because I was brushing my beard and the comb would keep catching it. I've been aware of it for at least a few months but was finally able to see what it was. Any idea what this could be?

       "I’ve had this little patch for a few weeks now and I’ve tried a few different things. I’ve tried applying clotrimazole and hydrocortisone. I’ve tried keeping the area moist with Vaseline and non scented lip balms. I’ve started taking a vitamin b complex vitamin for about a week now. The weird part is it seems to get smaller and less red and then the next day it’s bigger and more red?? It honestly never appears to be cracked either and it’s not sore.. just this red mark that grows and shrinks in size lol.

       "Hi there, I recently badly burned myself and it has resulted in a handful of different blisters on my hand. It's been a couple days now since this happened, and I am actually surprised I haven't ended up popping the biggest one on accident yet. It's gotten bigger than the size it was the following day after it showed up, but after it grew bigger the first time it hasn't changed much since then. My question is, it's really bothering me the location where it's at functionality-wise. I feel it will get accidentally popped on its own on accident at some point. However I know that blisters are your body's natural bandage/protection mechanism and it does wonders to prevent the spread of infection. However if I end up accidentally popping this one unexpectedly without realizing it at first to clean it and bandage it to protect it, I'm afraid I'll end up getting a skin infection anyway. What do you guys think, should I pop the big one? I'm perfectly fine with leaving the several smaller little ones alone but this one is killing me. However if you guys think it would be best just try to leave it alone, I'll try and comply.      1\n",

       "\\n\\nThis patch of skin seems to be completely inflamed, damaged, and just flat out angry. I don’t get active acne anymore but this agitation has been persisting for months. Maybe my skin barrier is completely destroyed but my skin keeps breaking open to reveal very small, surface-level openings with raw skin below. On some nights, I wake up to a slight yellow crust on top of these openings alongside inflammation. \\n\\nI wash my face two times a day and have refrained from using any actives on this patch of skin. I know I need to see a derm but does anyone have any ideas? My routine is simple and I always make sure to have it moisturized with spf during the PM. Anything is appreciated.

My question is, it's really bothering me the location where it's at functionality-wise. I feel it will get accidentally popped on its own on accident at some point. However I know that blisters are your body's natural bandage/protection mechanism and it does wonders to prevent the spread of infection. However if I end up accidentally popping this one unexpectedly without realizing it at first to clean it and bandage it to protect it, I'm afraid I'll end up getting a skin infection anyway. What do you guys think, should I pop the big one? I'm perfectly fine with leaving the several smaller little ones alone but this one is killing me.

For starters I work in food service and I wash my hands dozens of times a day. No one else at my work seems to experience this I’m assuming it’s contact dermatitis. I experience bleeding and cracking. It’s usually not itchy but sometimes it can be. Usually I experience an intense burning feeling. I also live in Alaska and it’s obviously a very dry climate here. This picture is actually what my hands look like on a good day. Does this appear to be contact dermatitis? 2nd question is, I work full time, and am also a full time college student so I don’t have the time to go to a doctor/ the money. What remedies can I use on my hands to help with this?   \n",

I’ve been using a drawing salve the past few weeks, it’s maybe gotten smaller but is still noticeable and grey. It’s been there for a while now I just figured it would go away on its own but it’s driving me insane. Thank you!   \n",

I've been aware of it for at least a few months but was finally able to see what it was. Any idea what this could be? The comb catches it as I am brushing up so the \"lip\" of it is at the top.   \n",

I’ve tried applying clotrimazole and hydrocortisone. I’ve tried keeping the area moist with Vaseline and non scented lip balms. I’ve started taking a vitamin b complex vitamin for about a week now. The weird part is it seems to get smaller and less red and then the next day it’s bigger and more red?? It honestly never appears to be cracked either and it’s not sore.. just this red mark that grows and shrinks in size lol. Any other ideas?   \n",

       "145  Hi there, I recently badly burned myself and it has resulted in a handful of different blisters on my hand. It's been a couple days now since this happened, and I am actually surprised I haven't ended up popping the biggest one on accident yet. It's gotten bigger than the size it was the following day after it showed up, but after it grew bigger the first time it hasn't changed much since then. My question is, it's really bothering me the location where it's at functionality-wise. I feel it will get accidentally popped on its own on accident at some point. However I know that blisters are your body's natural bandage/protection mechanism and it does wonders to prevent the spread of infection. However if I end up accidentally popping this one unexpectedly without realizing it at first to clean it and bandage it to protect it, I'm afraid I'll end up getting a skin infection anyway. What do you guys think, should I pop the big one? I'm perfectly fine with leaving the several smaller little ones alone but this one is killing me. However if you guys think it would be best just try to leave it alone, I'll try and comply.   \n",

I don’t get active acne anymore but this agitation has been persisting for months. Maybe my skin barrier is completely destroyed but my skin keeps breaking open to reveal very small, surface-level openings with raw skin below. On some nights, I wake up to a slight yellow crust on top of these openings alongside inflammation. \\n\\nI wash my face two times a day and have refrained from using any actives on this patch of skin. I know I need to see a derm but does anyone have any ideas? My routine is simple and I always make sure to have it moisturized with spf during the PM. Anything is appreciated. I also use a gentle hydrating cleanser!   \n",

It first started above my lip, now it’s progressed to under my lips on either side and also just under my eyelids.  The ones around my mouth get itchy and feel tight.  I’ve been putting Triamcinalone on it cause it helped but I tried to stop and it flared up like crazy now I have been putting Aveeno hydrocortisone on it and I don’t think it’s doing anything. I took prednisone in combination with the triamcinalone and it went almost completely away but now it’s just really bad. Any questions or requests for more pictures no problem.

If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment, and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options.</td>\n",

You can find retinol in many over-the-counter skin care products. Retinol can penetrate deep into your skin’s layers to activate collagen and elastin, which give your skin structure and support to prevent wrinkles.

Cysts are non-cancerous lumps that can cause discomfort or pain, especially when they grow in size. It is important not to squeeze or pop a cyst as this can cause infection. Similarly, if a cyst bursts under your skin, it can cause the surrounding tissue to become infected. There are hundreds of different types of cysts that form for many different reasons, such as infections or blockages in ducts. You should consult your dermatologist for surgical excision.   \n",
       "3  It is a case of common wart. This noncancerous growth appears when your skin is infected with one of the many viruses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) family. If you cut or damage your skin in some way, it's easier for the virus to take hold. That's why people with chronic skin conditions, such as eczema, or who bite their nails or pick at hangnails are prone to getting warts. Warts are highly contagious and are mainly passed by direct skin contact, such as when you pick at your warts and then touch another area of your body. You can also spread them with things like towels or razors that have touched a wart on your body or on someone else's. Most warts are harmless, and you don't need to do anything unless, of course, they're painful or embarrassing. Over-the-counter gels, liquids, and pads with salicylic acid work by peeling away the dead skin cells of the wart to gradually dissolve it. For better results, soak the wart in warm water, then gently sand it with a disposable emery board before you apply the product. Be sure to use a new emery board each time. Be patient, it can take several months. If you have diabetes or a weakened immune system, you should have a doctor take a look before you treat a wart yourself. Cryotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment, and topical cantharidin are good therapeutic options.    \n",

Retinoids that include retinol, retinal aldehyde (Retin-A), retinyl esters, adapalene, tazarotene, and tretinoin are chemicals that come from vitamin A that help reduce lines and wrinkles in your skin and improve your skin’s texture, pigment and hydration levels. You can find retinol in many over-the-counter skin care products. Retinol can penetrate deep into your skin’s layers to activate collagen and elastin, which give your skin structure and support to prevent wrinkles. Also, you can try nonsurgical procedures at the dermatology clinic like microneedling, chemical peeling, laser resurfacing, Botox injection, and soft tissue fillers injection.   \n",
