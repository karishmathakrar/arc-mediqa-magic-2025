      "    {\n",
      "  \"SIZE\": \"Lesions are variable in size, ranging from small papules/macules (few millimeters to thumbnail size) to larger discrete or coalescing plaques measuring up to 1-2 cm, with some confluent areas covering several centimeters. The overall affected area on the lower leg is extensive, significantly larger than a palm.\",\n",
      "  \"SITE_LOCATION\": \"Primarily affects the lower leg and ankle, specifically the anterior, lateral, and possibly medial aspects of the distal leg and ankle. A foot is visible in the image frame.\",\n",
      "  \"SKIN_DESCRIPTION\": \"The skin shows polymorphic lesions including erythematous papules, macules, excoriations, erosions, and raised, ill-defined to discrete plaques. The surface is characterized by prominent scales, serous and hemorrhagic crusts, and signs suggestive of weeping/oozing in some areas. The background skin is markedly dry, scaly, and shows significant thickening consistent with lichenification, particularly around the ankle. Lesion boundaries range from discrete for smaller papules to irregular and indistinct for larger confluent plaques.\",\n",
      "  \"LESION_COLOR\": \"Predominant colors are erythematous (ranging from pink to dark red or reddish-purple) on inflammatory papules and plaques. Scales and crusts appear yellowish-white to brown. Darker pigmentation, suggestive of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or purpuric changes, and dark puncta (likely hemorrhagic crusts) are also visible. The affected area is notably redder than surrounding less affected skin.\",\n",
      "  \"LESION_COUNT\": \"Numerous distinct lesions are present alongside areas of confluent involvement. Due to the density and coalescence, an exact count is not possible, but many dozens (>50) of individual lesions are visible on the lower leg. The distribution is scattered and widespread over the visible lower leg and ankle.\",\n",
      "  \"EXTENT\": \"The condition is widespread on the visible lower leg and ankle, affecting a significant portion of the visible skin surface (estimated 50-75%). The full extent of involvement on other body parts cannot be determined from these images.\",\n",
      "  \"TEXTURE\": \"Texture is notably rough due to the presence of prominent scales, crusts, excoriations, and significant skin thickening consistent with lichenification, particularly around the ankle. Dryness is prominent. The texture is inconsistent across the affected area, ranging from slightly raised papules to markedly thickened, scaly plaques.\",\n",

The surface is characterized by prominent scales, serous and hemorrhagic crusts, and signs suggestive of weeping/oozing in some areas.

      "  \"SITE_LOCATION\": \"Primarily affects the lower leg and ankle, specifically the anterior, lateral, and possibly medial aspects of the distal leg and ankle. A foot is visible in the image frame.\",\n",
      "  \"SKIN_DESCRIPTION\": \"The skin shows polymorphic lesions including erythematous papules, macules, excoriations, erosions, and raised, ill-defined to discrete plaques. The surface is characterized by prominent scales, serous and hemorrhagic crusts, and signs suggestive of weeping/oozing in some areas. The background skin is markedly dry, scaly, and shows significant thickening consistent with lichenification, particularly around the ankle. Lesion boundaries range from discrete for smaller papules to irregular and indistinct for larger confluent plaques.\",\n",

Scales and crusts appear yellowish-white to brown. Darker pigmentation, suggestive of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or purpuric changes, and dark puncta (likely hemorrhagic crusts) are also visible. The affected area is notably redder than surrounding less affected skin.\",\n",
      "  \"LESION_COUNT\": \"Numerous distinct lesions are present alongside areas of confluent involvement.

The distribution is scattered and widespread over the visible lower leg and ankle.\",\n",

The condition is characterized by polymorphic lesions including erythematous papules, plaques, extensive excoriations, crusts, and prominent scaling, all superimposed on markedly dry, thickened, and lichenified skin. Key features strongly indicate chronic itching and secondary changes due to scratching and rubbing.
